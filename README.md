# Probabilistic Graphical Model I - Representations

## 1. Decision Making
You have learned to how to model uncertainty in the world using graphical models and how to perform queries on those models to ask questions about the world. You have also learned the basics of decision making in this uncertain world using the principle of maximum expected utility. In this assignment, you will explore how to represent decision making in the framework of graphical models along with some of the algorithmic issues that arise. Specifically, you will learn how to represent influence diagrams as a sort of Bayes Net and perform inference over this representation. By the end of this assignment, you will have applied these new techniques to solve a real-world problem in medical care and treatment.

## 2. Bayes Nets for Genetic Inheritance
Genetic counselors want your help in advising couples with a family history of a genetic disease. Specifically, they want to help such couples decide whether to have a biological child or to adopt by assessing the probability that their un-born child will have the disease. Through this assignment, you will see how Bayesian networks can be used to determine such probabilities through modeling the mechanism of genetic inheritance.
